# Tongasoa! 👋 🇲🇬

This is a fun quiz game to know more about Madagascar and its 22 regions.

After its colonization, Madagascar had 6 provinces: 
- Antananarivo 🏢
- Antsiranana 🌴
- Mahajanga ☀️
- Toamasina 🐋
- Fianarantsoa ⛰️
- Toliara 🌅

On Oct. 4th 2009, they were disolved and became the 22 regions, also known locally as "faritra".
Can you guess the name of each region according to the given map? 

## How to play
You'll be given 22 guesses. 
Enter the region name in the box.
When you guess right, the region will be displayed on the map.
At the end of the game, the list if region(s) you didn't get will be sent to you.

For a two worded region name, don't add the "-" in between.

Good luck! 😄

## Hint 💡 
There are this many regions in one ex-province:
- Antananarivo : 4
- Antsiranana : 2
- Mahajanga : 4
- Toamasina : 3
- Fianarantsoa : 6
- Toliara : 4

Thank you for stopping by!
